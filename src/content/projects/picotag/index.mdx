description: "PicoTag is a portable, open‑source hardware hacking toolkit built around the Raspberry Pi Pico. Its custom CircuitPython firmware presents a USB‑CDC command‑line interface that dynamically loads modular commands—letting you scan and control JTAG/SWD pins, sniff and inject SPI, I²C and UART traffic, drive GPIO banks and NeoPixels, measure voltages, and more. With SD‑card‑based module loading and a lightweight command framework, PicoTag streamlines low‑level debugging, protocol fuzzing, and embedded reverse‑engineering tasks on the go."
