## Overview

This project is my fully customized golf cart buildâ€”combining mechanical restoration, electronics integration, and embedded systems.

## Mechanical Restoration

- Started with a basic single-seat golf cart chassis in rough condition; stripped it down completely, rebuilding for performance and aesthetics.
- Frame cleaned, primed with epoxy primer, then painted gloss black with automotive-grade paint using a spray gun and compressor.
- Applied cut-tape techniques and explored custom vinyl wrapping for accent panels, achieving a professional, high-end finish.

## Electronics Integration

- Designed and implemented a custom wiring harness supporting UART-based debugging, sensor integration, and OBD-style telemetry.
- Planned embedded controller module for sensor communication via UART/SPI protocols, providing diagnostic telemetry for battery voltage, speed, temperature, and potential GPS tracking.
- Future plans include integrating an OLED display to visualize battery status, speed, or system diagnostics in real-time.

## Design Philosophy

- Emphasis on modularity and serviceability, mirroring my embedded product-design approach in other projects.
- Utilized fused power circuits, clearly labeled wiring harnesses, and tidy cable management throughout the chassis.
- Consideration for future expansion with LoRa modules enabling remote telemetry or advanced functionality such as remote start/stop.

## Technical Details

- **Tools & Processes**: MIG welding, epoxy priming, automotive-grade paint application (2K clear coat), custom wiring looms, UART and OBD diagnostic interfaces, sensor network integration, CNC fabrication, and terminal-driven embedded debugging environments.

## Purpose & Applications

The golf cart serves not only as a custom vehicle but also as a rolling test-bed for:

- Embedded system experiments
- Automotive hacking
- Reverse engineering tool testing
- CAN/UART hybrid sensor network development

## Project Status

This is an ongoing project with future goals to expand the electronics suite, enhance battery management solutions, and explore advanced automotive networking strategies, particularly focusing on CAN and UART hybrids.
