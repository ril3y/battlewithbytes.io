Ever found yourself needing a quick and easy way to poke at hardware, read GPIO states, interact with SPI or I2C devices, or maybe even dump firmware, without setting up a complex JTAG/SWD debugger or writing throwaway scripts from scratch? Enter **PicoTag**.

## What is PicoTag?

PicoTag is a firmware project built entirely in **CircuitPython**, designed to run on the versatile and affordable **Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)**. At its core, PicoTag transforms your Pico into an interactive hardware multitool, accessible via a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) over USB Serial.

Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for hardware interaction. Need to check if a pin is high or low? Send some SPI commands? Sniff I2C traffic? PicoTag aims to provide a flexible, extensible platform to do just that, leveraging the ease of Python for development and interaction.

## Why PicoTag?

Many hardware interaction tools exist, but they often require specific desktop software, complex setups, or low-level C/C++ programming. PicoTag aims to bridge the gap by:

1.  **Leveraging CircuitPython:** Making hardware interaction accessible through high-level Python code. Easy to understand, modify, and extend.
2.  **Modularity:** Building functionality through self-contained modules that can be easily added or removed from the Pico's filesystem.
3.  **Interactivity:** Providing an immediate CLI for running commands and getting feedback.
4.  **Portability:** The RP2040 Pico is small, cheap, and readily available.

## Current Progress: The Foundation is Laid

Looking at the current codebase (`boot_out.txt` confirms CircuitPython 9.1.1 on a Pico), the foundational elements of PicoTag are already in place:

*   **Modular Architecture:** A robust `ModuleManager` dynamically loads Python modules from the `/modules` directory on the Pico's flash filesystem. Each module encapsulates specific functionality (e.g., interacting with a specific chip, protocol, or interface).
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A `CLI` class (`cli.py`) provides the user interface over `usb_cdc` (Serial). It handles input, command parsing, backspace, and executes commands registered by the loaded modules. The prompt `(⚡)Pico>` gives it a distinct identity.
*   **Command Handling:** A base `Command` class (`command.py`) allows modules to define their own specific commands with descriptions and execution logic. These commands are registered globally by the `ModuleManager`.
*   **Resource Management:** A `ResourceManager` (`resource_manager.py`) handles shared hardware resources like SPI peripherals (`SPICoreModule`) or LEDs (`LEDsCoreModule`), ensuring modules don't conflict.
*   **Dependency Management:** Modules can declare dependencies (like needing access to the 'spi' resource), and the `ModuleManager` ensures these are met before loading.
*   **Core Services:** Essential services like a configurable Logger (`logger.py`) with color support (`colors.py`) are integrated.
*   **Example Code:** The presence of a `GPIOTester` class (even if commented out in the main execution flow) demonstrates the intended use case – interacting directly with GPIO pins.

Currently, the system boots, initializes core resources (SPI, LEDs), loads any modules found in `/modules`, and presents the user with the CLI, ready to accept commands.

## Future Ideas and Potential Uses

The modular foundation opens up a world of possibilities for PicoTag. Here are just a few ideas:

*   **Protocol Modules:**
    *   **I2C:** Scan buses, read/write from devices, interact with sensors.
    *   **UART:** Bridge UART interfaces, send/receive data.
    *   **1-Wire:** Communicate with devices like DS18B20 temperature sensors.
    *   **CAN Bus:** Interface with CAN networks (requires appropriate transceiver hardware).
    *   **JTAG/SWD:** Basic boundary scan or interaction using the RP2040's PIO for bit-banging (challenging but possible).
*   **Device Interaction Modules:**
    *   **Flash Memory:** Read/write SPI NOR flash chips (like BIOS chips).
    *   **EEPROM:** Interact with I2C or SPI EEPROMs.
    *   **NFC/RFID:** Modules for common NFC/RFID reader ICs (e.g., PN532).
    *   **Display Drivers:** Control small OLED or LCD screens via I2C/SPI.
*   **Testing & Analysis Modules:**
    *   **Logic Analyzer:** Basic logic analysis using PIO and buffering.
    *   **Signal Generator:** Simple PWM or pattern generation.
    *   **GPIO Tester:** An enhanced version of the example, allowing configuration of pull-ups/downs and direction.
*   **Enhanced Framework:**
    *   **Scripting:** Allow sequences of commands to be run from a file.
    *   **SD Card Support:** Load modules or log data to an SD card (the code hints at `sdcard_modules`).
    *   **API Integration:** Develop the `apis.py` concept for inter-module communication or external control.
    *   **Data Sinks:** Utilize the `sink.py` abstraction for flexible output (e.g., logging to file, sending over network via Pico W).
