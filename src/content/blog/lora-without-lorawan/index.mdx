# LoRa Without LoRaWAN  

This is about using LoRa the way it was meant to be used — simple, fast, and without LoRaWAN bloat.  

LoRaWAN is great for big networks.  
But for embedded projects like Boats No Woes — it’s completely unnecessary.  

## My Use Case  

Project: Boats No Woes  

Goal: Ultra-low power sensor network for boats.  

Hardware: RAK3172 module (STM32WLE5 + SX1262 radio)  

Problem:  
- I don’t need LoRaWAN join procedures.  
- I don’t want AT command parsing.  
- I don’t need network servers.  

What I want:  
- Raw LoRa packets.  
- Full control over the radio.  
- Deterministic timing.  
- Minimal power usage.  

## How I Did It  

The RAK3172 is perfect — once you erase the AT firmware.  

Flash it with your own STM32 code using STM32CubeMX:  

Guide here:  
https://stm32world.com/wiki/RAK3172#Setting_up_the_IOC_file  

Important Settings:  

- Disable everything you don’t need.  
- Setup only:  
  - UART (for CLI)  
  - GPIO (for sensors / wake / LEDs)  
  - RTC (low power wakeup)  
- Enable the SX1262 radio driver.  

Bare metal LoRa means:  

```c  
Radio.SetTxConfig(...);  
Radio.Send(buffer, length);  
```  

Done. No stacks. No middleware. No magic.  

## Why This Rocks  

- Lower power — I decide when to sleep.  
- Smaller binary — flash is for code I wrote.  
- Simpler debugging — packets in / packets out.  
- Total control of LoRa parameters:  
  - Bandwidth  
  - Spreading Factor  
  - TX Power  
  - Frequencies  

## Boats No Woes Design  

- LoRa TX for hatch sensors / battery alerts.  
- LoRa RX for ACK or remote commands.  
- CLI over UART for config / debugging.  
- SD card logging of traffic.  

Network Architecture:  

```
[Sensor] ---> LoRa ---> [Gateway MCU] ---> WiFi/LTE ---> Cloud  
```  

Future ideas:  

- LoRa-based OTA updates.  
- Custom packet framing + encryption.  
- Wake-on-radio or preamble sniffing for ultra-low power.  

## Final Thoughts  

LoRa without LoRaWAN is the right move for embedded control systems.  

My rule:  

> If you own the network — you don’t need LoRaWAN.  

Raw LoRa is faster, cleaner, and puts control back in your hands.  

Battle With Bytes is about control.  

Hardware-first.  
Minimal dependencies.  
Maximum ownership.  

More coming soon.
