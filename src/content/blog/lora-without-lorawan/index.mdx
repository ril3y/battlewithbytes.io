LoRa (Long Range) technology is often paired with LoRaWAN, but LoRa itself is simply a radio modulation technique. LoRaWAN adds network management, security layers, and other protocol overhead. For many embedded applications, especially those requiring minimal latency, low power, and straightforward point-to-point (P2P) communication, direct LoRa programming is preferable.
</DropCap>

This guide explores programming the RAK3172 module directly, bypassing LoRaWAN completely.

## Overview: Direct LoRa Programming

Direct LoRa programming allows developers to:

- Send and receive raw LoRa packets.
- Precisely manage radio states and transitions.
- Achieve deterministic timing and low latency.
- Minimize firmware complexity and reduce power consumption.

## RAK3172 Module

The RAK3172 integrates an STM32WLE5 microcontroller with an SX1262 radio chip, providing a compact and highly capable platform for custom LoRa solutions.

          <h3>Preamble</h3>
          <p>The preamble is a sequence of symbols sent at the beginning of every LoRa packet. It allows the receiver to detect the presence of a signal and synchronize to the incoming data stream.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Typical value:</strong> 8â€“12 symbols (but can be longer for low-power wakeup scenarios)</li>
            <li><strong>Configuration example:</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <CodeBlock code={`// Set the preamble length to 8 symbols\nSX126xSetPreambleLength(&SX126x, 8);`} language="c" />
          <div className="info-box">
            <strong>How does the preamble length affect the signal?</strong><br />
            Setting the preamble length controls how many up-chirp symbols are sent at the start of each LoRa packet. Each up-chirp is a full symbol, and the total number defines how long the receiver has to detect and synchronize to the signal before actual data is sent. More up-chirps = longer preamble = easier synchronization (but longer airtime).
          </div>
          <h4 className="mt-1_5em-placeholder">What does the LoRa preamble look like?</h4>
          <p>The preamble in a LoRa packet is a series of identical up-chirps, which help the receiver synchronize to the incoming signal.</p>

          <h4>What is an Up-Chirp in LoRa?</h4>
          <p>In LoRa, an up-chirp is a frequency sweep from the lowest to the highest frequency in the channel. Digitally, for SF7 (spreading factor 7), the baseband up-chirp can be represented as an array of 128 complex samples, each with a specific phase increment:</p>
          <CodeBlock code={`// Pseudo-representation for SF7 (128 samples)\nfor (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) {\n    // upchirp[i] = complex value based on exp(j * 2 * PI * (i*i) / 256)\n    upchirp[i] = calculate_complex_sample(i);\n}`} language="c" />
          <p>This is not a simple binary or hex constant, but a mathematical sequence. The receiver looks for this "chirp" pattern to synchronize.</p>

          <h3>Sync Word</h3>
          <p>The sync word is a value that follows the preamble in a LoRa packet. It allows the receiver to differentiate between networks operating on the same frequency.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Typical values:</strong> 0x12 (private networks), 0x34 (public LoRaWAN)</li>

          <h3>Spreading Factor (SF)</h3>
          <p>The spreading factor determines how many chips represent each bit of data. It's a key parameter that affects range, data rate, and airtime.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Range:</strong> SF7 (shortest range, highest data rate) to SF12 (longest range, lowest data rate)</li>

          <p>The coding rate adds redundancy to your data to improve error correction capabilities. It's expressed as a fraction like 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, or 4/8.</p>
          <ul>

## Erasing Default Firmware

Before loading custom firmware, erase the default AT-command-based firmware to free up memory and remove unnecessary functionalities.

## Firmware Development with STM32CubeMX

Use STM32CubeMX to configure the firmware:

- **Disable unused peripherals** to conserve resources.
- Enable only the required interfaces, typically:
  - UART for command-line interactions and debugging.
  - GPIO for sensor interfacing and control signals.
  - RTC for scheduled wake-ups and precise timing.
- Activate the SX1262 radio driver for direct radio control.

A detailed setup guide is available on [STM32World's RAK3172 page](https://stm32world.com/wiki/RAK3172#Setting_up_the_IOC_file).

## Direct LoRa Radio Usage

Direct control of the SX1262 radio enables straightforward, clear, and efficient communication:

<CodeBlock
  code={`// Set radio transmission parameters\nRadio.SetTxConfig(MODEM_LORA, power, bandwidth, datarate, codingRate,\n                  preambleLength, fixLen, crcOn, freqHopOn, hopPeriod,\n                  iqInverted, timeout);\n\n// Send data buffer via LoRa\nRadio.Send(buffer, length);`}
  language="c"
