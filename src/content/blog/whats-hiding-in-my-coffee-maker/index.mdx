Ever wondered what your coffee maker might be hiding? With the rise of smart appliances, even a humble brew machine could be running embedded firmware — and that means there's something to hack.
In this post, I used my [PicoTag project](https://github.com/ril3y/picotag) to dump the SPI flash memory from my coffee maker and dig into what kind of system it's running.

## Hardware Overview

The flash chip inside the coffee maker is a Winbond **W25Q128JVSQ**, a common 128Mbit (16MB) SPI NOR flash chip.

## Step 1: Identifying the Flash Chip

To begin, I opened up the unit and visually identified the flash as:

- **Manufacturer:** Winbond
- **Model:** W25Q128JVSQ
- **Package:** SOIC-8
- **Interface:** SPI
- **Capacity:** 128Mbit (16MB)

I verified the part by searching for the [datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/949/w25q128jv_revf_03272018_plus-1489608.pdf) and checking the pinout and features.

## Step 2: Dumping the Firmware

### Option 1: In-Circuit Dump

First attempt was an in-circuit read using the PicoTag tool, powered via USB:

> **TODO:** Add photo of clip-on connection to flash chip  
> `<Insert Image Here>`

- Connected PicoTag to SPI lines using a SOIC-8 test clip
- Powered the flash externally (3.3V)
- Verified signal integrity with a logic analyzer

This sometimes works — if the MCU isn’t holding the bus or interfering.

### Option 2: Desolder and Dump

If in-circuit read fails:

> **TODO:** Add photo of desoldered chip and breadboard adapter  
> `<Insert Image Here>`

- Carefully desoldered the chip using hot air
- Mounted on a breakout board or directly into a ZIF socket
- Used PicoTag to read and dump the contents

## Step 3: Parsing the Dump

After dumping, I saved the binary as `coffeemaker_dump.bin`.

First inspection steps:

```bash
xxd coffeemaker_dump.bin | less
binwalk coffeemaker_dump.bin
strings coffeemaker_dump.bin | less
```
