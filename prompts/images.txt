A 2D digital graphic design featuring a minimal, retro-tech aesthetic. The image should use a dark background with neon accent colors like green (#00ff9d) and blue (#0088ff). The style should feel like a hacker terminal or vintage embedded device manual.

Focus on clean lines, futuristic tech iconography, and embedded systems themes. Include elements like circuit traces, radio waves, microcontrollers, UART interfaces, or LoRa communication symbols.

Text is allowed only for short technical labels or schematic annotations â€” but do not include the blog title or marketing slogans. Avoid background grids (already handled by CSS).
